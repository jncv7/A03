There are a couple of words to note when using github:
- Branch: This represents a line of development. Think of it as different timelines of the code you make.
- Clone: This is a copy of the repository of what is on GitHub. This should be your local copy of what is in the cloud.
- Commit: This is a picture of your code at a specific time. This can also be used to explain a change in code.
- GIT: This is a VCS (Version Control System)
- GitHub: This is the company that hosts the VCS called Git. They can be said to be a cloud of code for many users.
- Merge: This is when you combine branches. Think about 2 different timelines joining together.
- Merge Conflict: When you create a paradox while merging, you get a conflict. Git will prevent this from happening.
- Push: This is when you try to upload your local commits to the cloud.
- Pull: This is when you try to download from the cloud to the local system.
- Remote: This is your laptop. You have control everything here without messing with things in the cloud.
- Repository: This is a collection of files. Think about it as the world you are making with code.
